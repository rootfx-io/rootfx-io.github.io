# Building Embedded Systems: Raspberry Pi, Linux, and ELBE

I’m currently working on this hands-on guide to building Debian-based embedded Linux systems for Raspberry Pi using ELBE.  

You’ll learn Linux fundamentals, Debian internals, and real-world image-building workflows through practical, production-focused recipes — including:

- Custom kernels  
- Secure filesystems  
- Containers  
- QEMU  
- Raspberry Pi 5 development  

The book will be launched soon. If you’d like to get notified, subscribe on [Substack](https://rootfx.substack.com/subscribe).
